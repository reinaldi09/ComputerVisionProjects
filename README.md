# Computer Vision Practice Projects

## Description

Welcome to the **Computer Vision Practice Projects** repository! This repository is a collection of my previous projects, including those from learning courses, fun personal experiments, and freelance work. Each project is designed to explore and understand different aspects of computer vision, using a variety of techniques and tools.

Whether you're a beginner looking to get started or an experienced practitioner aiming to refine your skills, this repository offers a range of projects that cover fundamental concepts to advanced applications in computer vision. Dive in to see how I've applied computer vision techniques to solve real-world problems, learn new skills, and have fun along the way!

2. **Object Detection**
   - Implement object detection algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector).
   - Experiment with detecting multiple objects in an image.

3. **Image Segmentation**
   - Understand image segmentation using techniques like U-Net.
   - Segment different parts of an image with pixel-level accuracy.

4. **Face Recognition**
   - Develop face recognition systems using pre-trained models like FaceNet.
   - Implement techniques for identifying and verifying faces in images.

5. **Image Enhancement**
   - Apply various image enhancement techniques such as super-resolution and noise reduction.
   - Use models like SRCNN (Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network).

6. **Pose Estimation**
   - Implement pose estimation algorithms to detect human poses.
   - Explore techniques like OpenPose.

7. **Deep Learning for Computer Vision**
   - Dive into advanced deep learning techniques for computer vision.
   - Use frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch to build custom models.
